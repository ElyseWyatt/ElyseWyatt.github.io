    <h1>My First Reflections</h1>
    <h2>My take on the DBC/EDA Experience</h2>
    <p>The DBC/EDA experience really resonates with me, and I've learnt or been reminded of a few great things while watching the video. Namely, we are all in this together and need to have a hacker mindset. Also, it's up to us to get out what we put in</p>
<h2>What are my impressions?</h2>
<p>My impressions are good. I really like a lot of what Shereef says, and some of it I didn't actually know!</p>
<h2>How do I see myself engaging in this type of culture?</h2>
    <p>I love the type of culture Shereef talks about. I thrive in collaborative environments, and learning by doing is the way I learn best. Super excited!</p>
<h2>Have my expectations of EDA changed?</h2>
<p>It was good to be reminded that this is not an off the shelf product or service. He is right when he talks about our mindsets often being conditioned to expect that. I think I felt like that when I was freaking out in the first couple of hours, and it's a good prompt to not think like that.</p>
<h2>Am I excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</h2>
<p>Very excited! I'm looking forward to doing a lot more group activities. I'm nervous about the sheer amount of work there is to do. But I have faith it will be okay.</p>

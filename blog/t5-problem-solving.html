                  I got blocked on a simple problem completing 5.2, Event Handling. My code wasn't working and it turned out I had written ID instead of Id. I tried looking back through the instructions, going over each line of my code to see if there was anything which looked strange. Finally I compared my code to someone elses. And it wasn't until I went back through it individually line by line again that I picked up the mistake. I learnt that sometimes you can be really stuck on something, but it can be just a simple mistake so I shouldn't get too worried. It also highlighted the importance of taking immense care when writing the original code.

                <div class="blurb">
                  Pseudocode: I can't figure out what this one means! Trying something: This problem-solving method I feel an average level of confidence using. Sometimes I'm too scared to try something. Rubber ducky method: This would be a good one to try, when I can understand the code a bit better. Reading error messages: this one is helpful and I've used it before. Console.logging: this one I don't feel confident using. Googling: this one I feel confident using. Asking your peers for help: This one I feel quite confident using. Asking coaches for help: This one I feel quite confident using. Improving your process with reflection: This one I don't feel too confident using as it doesn't seem to work very well for me.

              <div>
                <div class="blurb"> The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.

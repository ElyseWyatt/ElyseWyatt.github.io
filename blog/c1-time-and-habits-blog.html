    <h1>My Reflections On Time And Habit Techniques</h1>
    <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did I try?</h2>
    <p>I tried meditating for around 5 minutes (which was quite hard), and also timeboxed just using Toggle</p>
    <h2>What did I find interesting?</h2>
<p>I found some of the research around meditation really interesting! And it was also a really nice reminder to build habits using the small and often approach. Often good things start out very small.</p>
<h2>What worked for me?</h2>
  <p>Not counting on myself to always be motivated has really worked for me. For example, I get all my meals delivered, and I have a personal trainer. That way I don't need to worry about cooking healthy (the healthy food just turns up) and I don't have to worry about always being motivated to push myself with exercise as I have the trainer to help me! The same will apply to study and development.</p>
  <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h2>
<p>I would very much like to continue starting small with things, and just keeping them up. Also, meditation! I suffer from anxiety and I think it would really help.</p>

                  I tried meditating for around 5 minutes (which was quite hard), and also timeboxed just using Toggle. I found some of the research around meditation really interesting! And it was also a really nice reminder to build habits using the small and often approach. Often good things start out very small.

                  Not counting on myself to always be motivated has really worked for me. For example, I get all my meals delivered, and I have a personal trainer. That way I don't need to worry about cooking healthy (the healthy food just turns up) and I don't have to worry about always being motivated to push myself with exercise as I have the trainer to help me! The same will apply to study and development. I would very much like to continue starting small with things, and just keeping them up. Also, meditation! I suffer from anxiety and I think it would really help.

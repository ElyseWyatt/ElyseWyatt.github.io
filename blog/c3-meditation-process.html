                    This week we had to practice 'Process over Product' which is harder than it sounds! It felt like I didn't even understand the process, let alone the product. And I kept putting too much effort into things without moving on. But in the end I tried not to think of all the things I wanted my website to do, and just moved on to complete the tasks. Being reminded to not spend too much time on things was great.

                    Before reading chapter two, I knew a little about meditation and the benefits it creates. From reading the chapter, I learnt that we can invite things to stop distracting us. I also learnt that you can practice meditation in any position. Two things really stood out to me - 1. meditation is great for learning to deal with distractions and thoughts in a positive way (by not reacting immediately to anything), and 2. by practicing meditation, and becoming happier, you can actually help yourself be less likely to get sick.

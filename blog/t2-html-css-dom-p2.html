      <h2>GRID-BASED DESIGN</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Websites utilize a grid-type system to keep everything on a website in order. Grids are comprised of multiple parts, including 'units'(there are 12 units) and 'gutters' (the space between each unit).' Multiple units/gutters can form columns, which is a bit confusing. Having 12 units means when they are grouped together, they can always be even regardless of how they're grouped.</p>

      <h2>RESPONSIVE WEBPAGES</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Responsive webpages means the website is optimised for a variety of different devices. Content on the page will move around, and still look appealing, regardless of how you're viewing it. It's critically important that websites are optimised for different devices.</p>

      <h2>SEMANTIC STRUCTURE</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I think semantic structure is using elements which are meaningful, instead of generic.</p>
    </div>

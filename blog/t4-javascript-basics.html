                  HTML fills in the content of a webpage, while CSS styles it. JavaScript JavaScript powers the dynamic behavior on websites, or things that product different outcomes based on different variables.

              </div>
              <div>
                <div class="blurb">
                  Control flow statements enable JavaScript programs to make decisions by executing code based on a condition. For example, you could use control flows for brushing your teeth - if there is toothpaste in the tube, brush your teeth. If the toothpaste has run out, open a new tube. Loops let us tell the computer to loop over a block of code so we don't have to write out the same process over and over. We could use the teeth brushing code again and again for both initial options.

              <div>
                <div class="blurb">
                  Arrays are JavaScript's way of making lists. These lists can store any data types (including strings, numbers, and booleans) and they are ordered, meaning each item has a numbered position. JavaScript objects are containers that can store data and functions. The data we store in an object is not ordered â€” we can only access it by calling its associated key.

              <div>
                <div class="blurb">
                  A function is a block of code designed to perform a task. Functions are like recipes. They accept data, perform actions on that data, and return a result. The beauty of functions is that they allow us to write a block of code once, then we can reuse it over and over without rewriting the same code.

    <h2>How would I describe HTML, CSS and DOM?</h2>
    <p>HTML is the skeleton content of a website. It's all the stuff like text and images, without the lovely formatting and colours etc. CSS turns the skeleton into a "living thing" and is dictates all the various styling which goes into a webpage. The DOM is your html, but how your browser reads it, and can be found in Developer Tools</p>

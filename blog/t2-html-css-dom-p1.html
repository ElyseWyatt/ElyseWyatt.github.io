      <h2>How would I describe HTML, CSS and DOM?</h2>
      <p>HTML can be described as the skeleton content of a website. It's all the stuff like text and images, without the lovely formatting and colours etc. CSS turns the skeleton into a "living thing" and is dictates all the various styling which goes into a webpage. The DOM is your html, but how your browser reads it, and can be found in Developer Tools</p>
      <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
      <p>All content on a website sits inside boxes. Even if it looks like a circle, it sits inside a box.</p>
      <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
      <p>The CSS box model is a box which wraps around every HTML element, and consists of margins, boarders, padding and actual content. The box model controls the width and height of each component on a website.</p>

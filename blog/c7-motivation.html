                  I feel like I can describe my EDA journey through Pleasure, Passion and Purpose. I naturally want to complete tasks which are very easy first, such as writing these blogs. They give me instant gratification as I feel like I can tick something off the list. I do, however, really want to get to the point where coding is my Passion - something I do and love. It's currently lumped in the Purpose category, and is something I find extremely hard, but am doing because it contributes to a higher purpose. I need to go through the hard times so I can get to the good times later on.

              </div>
              <div>
                <div class="blurb">
                  My core values are: integrity and honesty, hard work, kindness to animals, common sense and logic, and doing good in the world. All of the above tie into what I stand for also.

              </div>
              <div>
                <div class="blurb">
                  I found the resilience exercise good. It feels difficult to think about faiure, but good to think about times we're you've been successful about something. I especially liked the snippet from Nathan Myhrvold: 'innovating involves being “confused, upset, think[ing] you’re stupid."' This inspired me as it's exactly how I've felt learning JavaScript!

                <div class="blurb">
                  I get triggered the most in programming when instructions aren't totally clear, or when learning information doesn't make sense according to my learning style. I have felt that way a lot through Sprint 4, 5 and 6, as we didn't have many exercises which took us through the problem and how it would be solved through JavaScript. We instead focused on little pieces of JavaScript, and it was hard to understand why they were important and where they would be used.

                <h3 class="blog-heading">SIBERIAN NORTH RAILROAD EXERCISE</h3>
              </div>
              <div>
                <div class="blurb">
                  The Siberian Railroad Exercise is this: "“Here is a practice called the Siberian North Railroad for dealing with triggers. This is a useful practice not only for triggers but also for other situations in which we need to deal with negative or distressing emotions.The practice has five steps: 1. Stop, 2. Breathe, 3. Notice, 4. Reflect, 5. Respond.” I found this exercise super helpful, as it forces you to take a small break from the situation (if you remember in time). Even the act of taking a break can help your mood in a big way. I also really like the part in the 'reflect' stage when it says "the person thinks acting this way will make him happy, in some way." Also responding with a desire for a positive outcome in mind is helpful and I've already been trying this technique with success.

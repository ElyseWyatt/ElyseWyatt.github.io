      <p>I found it completely fascinating how activation of a certain part of your brain can indicate whether you're experiencing more positive or negative emotions. I also love how emotional intelligence doesn't always just come to us automatically, but it can be a learned thing. I loved this chapter and am really looking forward to delving into more, as I think this will help me become a great developer but an even better human being.</p>

      <p>I practiced 2 minutes of mindfulness, and felt as though it was hard to concentrate. Looking forward to keeping it up and getting better.</p>

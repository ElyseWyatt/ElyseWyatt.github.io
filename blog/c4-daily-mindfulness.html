                  This exercise wanted me to find a loved-one to practice my mindful listening with. I needed to listen to them tell me something for 3 minutes, and in that time I needed to give their words and them my upmost attention with no interuptions from me. After that, I was to repeat back the different elements of what they were saying until I had a sound understanding. At the time of this exercise, there was no one around to practice with, so I'm yet to complete it.

              <div>
                <div class="blurb">
                  Out of the three suggested techniques, the one which seemed post applicable to me was resting my mind for 10 minutes each day, without absolutely having to commit to mindfulness. Also, I liked the option of just thinking in a mindful way once per day. That is something easy to keep up!

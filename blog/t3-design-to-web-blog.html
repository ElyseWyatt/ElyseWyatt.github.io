      <h2>RESPONSIVE SITES</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Rresponsive sites are important because they are optimised for a variety of different devices. Without it, people viewing on different devices to just a desktop computer will have a lesser experience.</p>

      <h2>MOBILE FIRST DESIGN</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Mobile First Design means you start building a website with mobile viewing in mind immediately. This is important, because viewing on mobiles is done by almost everyone.</p>

      <h2>FRAMEWORKS</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Frameworks are standardised concepts/practices/criteria for dealing with common problems. In web design, frameworks are basically packages of files, folders and standardised code which people can use to build websites faster. One of the downsides to frameworks is they may come with a bunch of code you don't need, so you have to wade through and pull it all out.</p>

      <h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>A wireframe is usually a hand-drawn mockup of a website. It can contain boxes and rough positioning of everything you want on a webpage.</p>

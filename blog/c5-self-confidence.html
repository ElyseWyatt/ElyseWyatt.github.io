                  There are three domains under self-awareness - emotional intelligence, accurate self-assessment, and self-confidence. Practicing mindfulness lets us hone our skills in these three areas of self-awareness.

                <div class="blurb">
                  The self-awareness practice I chose to complete this week was journalling. I wrote down things that give me pleasure, my strengths, things that annoy me, and my weaknesses. I really enjoyed this exercise because it made me very aware of what I like, what I don't like, and what I want to improve on. Without doing this exercise, I wouldn't have considered these things in a mindful way.

                <div class="blurb">
                  This section was really great, as it highlights that our emotions do not define us. I have a terrible habit of making decisions while in an emotional state, which I'm working on with success. I really liked the cloud example - some emotions are like beautiful clouds, some are like dark ones, but the sky stays the same. We are the sky, and must not forget this!

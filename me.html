                My name is Elyse, and I'm in love with interesting projects and things. Over the past few years I've been lucky to work with a whole bunch of cool companies. I've also helped out on meaningful initiatives, and even started some myself. 
                <br>
                Inspiration for me comes from people who turn nothing into something. New Zealand is filled with smart people doing this very thing, and in 2017 I decided to join them. I graduated as a Junior JavaScript Developer in early 2018.
                <br>
                Other things take up my time too. In 2016 I started Hardware Meetup AKL, an event series showcasing some of New Zealand's most exciting products and the founders and engineers creating them. And recently I've had the pleasure joining the organising team of Junior Dev NZ, a meetup helping to connect and upskill junior developers.
                <br>
                Oh yeah. Then there's that thing called a day job. A weird title I've picked up recently is Recruitment Strategist/Marketing Officer. I didn't study anything at university, and have never worked in recruitment or studied marketing. But this is a special position which utilises some of my experience, and is for the amazing software company Propellerhead. I've been there since 2016. Before that I spent time with these companies and initiatives: Mum's Garage, Techweek NZ, Creative HQ, Velox Innovation, Lightning Lab Manufactuirng, and Beany.
                <br>

                Outside of everything you'll find me collecting old things like vintage tobacco tins and anquties, and cuddling my ginger cat Tom.
